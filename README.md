## Overview

This project reimagines technical interviews by simulating a real-world experience. Unlike platforms like LeetCode, our application offers a database of coding problems and integrates authentic interview dynamics.

## Key Features

- **Realistic Interview Simulation:** Turn on your mic and camera to interact with a chatbot interviewer.
- **Interactive Problem Solving:** Explain your solutions and respond to follow-up questions, just like in a live interview.
- **Performance Recording:** Download a video of your interview session for review.
- **Comprehensive Feedback:** Receive insights on your solution, communication, posture, and more.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:  

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:  

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

```

## Roadmap

- Add more coding problems and interview scenarios.
- Enhance feedback with AI-driven analysis.
- Integrate additional video and audio features.
- Improve UI/UX for a seamless interview experience.
