# while unemployed:

This project is a new way of interviewing, The idea is that our program works similar to leetcode with a database of problems. 
The difference in our product is building something that focuses on making the interview experience more authentic. 

This means our product gives you the option to turn your mic and camera on. Then with a chatbot as your interviewer, 
you will be asked to explain your solution and asked follow up questions like it is a real interview. 
At the end you can download the recording of your interview and get feedback on not just getting the solution right, but posture, explanations, and 
additional insights. 

Updates will be made over time!
